## Short product summary
The main idea is to create an online foreign language learning platform.


## Authentication

After a succesfful account creation he will login using his own login and password.

## Functionality

### Core functions: 
- The learning platform will be a modern looking and responsive webpage.
- The users will learn the foreign language by using flashcards.
- One side of the card will contain a word in the foreign language.
- The flashcards will only contain words like verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns.
- There will be a collection of default flashcards containing a collection of the 100 most commonly used words on the planet.
- The user will have a option of providing a recording of his conversations in his native language. The provided recording will be analyzed and up to 50 mostly used words will be identified - a flashcard for each identified word pair (foreign vs native language) will be generated.
- For the initial phase the platform should support up to 10 most-commonly used foreign languages including Polish. 
- The application will support two native user languages english (default) or polish
- The other side of the flashcard will contain the word written in the users mother language.
- The foreign word when displayed (card filpped) will be made audible and pronounced out by a native-speaker.
- The user will be able to flip the card when he wishes to i.e. by clicking on the card surface
- The person that is learning will drag the flashcard to the left when she thinks that she gueed correctly the card or right if she did not guess it.
- The flashcards will be provided as long as the user has not guessed all of the flashcards or he has reached the daily flashcard learning limit.
- The daily flashcard display limit will be a configurable value in the user settings with a reasonable default value like 20.
- The user may choose to learn the word in cotenxt of full sentences. In that case the program will ask an online AI agent to embedded the word in a simple sentence. 
- After reaching the daily goal the program will ask AI to generate a short story in the foreign lanugage using the guessed words.


### Presentation:
- The cards should resemble the well known playing cards like the ones used for playing poker.
- When the card with the foreign language is fillped the contents should be read-out by a native speaker.
